# ELO_FOOTBALL
A redo of my previous ELO football project - I'm looking to use historical data to assign an ELO-rating to all English football teams

I get all data from https://www.worldfootball.net 
At this point, running datascraper.py, teams_dict.py and elo_calculator.py will give a top 100 list of the highest ELO ratings achieved. 

Each time is only on the table once, otherwise Manchester City would occupy most spots, as they'd take a new spot every time they played a game. 

Next step is calculating performance ratings, as this is what is actually interesting.
