# ELO_FOOTBALL
A redo of my previous ELO football project - I'm looking to use historical data to assign an ELO-rating to all English football teams

I get all data from https://www.worldfootball.net 
Have now built a datascraper. 
Unfortunately, cup games will never assign a draw, but will assign victory to whichever team won after tiebreaks. 
I want that to be changed.
